Below is an expanded outline to finalize or improve the plugin’s incomplete components:
A) Premium Access Verification
Integrate with Startempire Wire Membership.
• Implement an OAuth or membership check in the “verify_premium_access()” function, verifying if the token is valid, belongs to an active membership, and has screenshot privileges.
• Update error responses to provide membership-level details when a request fails.
Provide Admin UI Controls.
• Allow the plugin admin settings to store membership endpoints, client/secret if OAuth is required, and handle token refresh flows.
• Display membership statuses in the plugin’s “Dashboard” or “API Management” pages.
B) Fallback Services Expansion
Implement Actual API Calls.
• In “SEWN_API_Manager” or “SEWN_Screenshot_Service”, add a method to build and send requests to fallback providers (e.g., Screenshot Machine).
• Include robust error handling and parse the service’s response to produce a local file or forward a response URL.
Extend Admin Configuration.
• Collect and store fallback credentials in WordPress options.
• Provide a test interface to verify that the fallback service is reachable (under “API Tester” or “Tester Page”).
C) Full Testing Framework
Centralize Test Execution.
• Implement a direct test runner accessible via WP-CLI and/or from the “Test Results” page. This runner should call “SEWN_Test_Results::run_all_tests()”, collect results, and display them in a unified table or log.
Database Logging of Test Runs.
• Expand “SEWN_Test_Results” to store results in the custom table, capturing test name, success/failure, and time of test.
• Display them meaningfully in the “Test Results” admin screen, with filters or pagination if many tests are run.
D) Additional REST Endpoints for Membership and UI Flows
Enhanced Status Endpoint.
• Return membership statuses, fallback usage stats, and possible usage limits.
Protected Endpoints for Issuing Premium Tokens.
• Let administrators or authorized clients manage membership tokens, with logs stored in “SEWN_API_Logger.”
E) Automated Scheduling or Bulk Screenshot Generation
Implement WP-Cron Integration.
• Create a routine that checks for any pending bulk screenshot tasks, generating them at scheduled intervals to avoid server overload.
Provide Bulk Management in Admin.
• In “SEWN_Admin” or “SEWN_Dashboard” classes, add a UI for administrators to queue multiple screenshot capture requests and view progress.
Queued Logging.
• Log each step of the queue to the “wp_sewn_api_logs” table so administrators can troubleshoot failures.
F) Thorough Documentation and Example Code
Finish “README.md” with Usage Examples.
• Show code snippets for typical “fetch” or “curl” requests to “/wp-json/sewn-screenshots/v1/screenshot”.
• Include instructions on setting advanced config (like membership tokens).
G) Error Handling Improvements
Expand “try/catch” blocks in “SEWN_Ajax_Handler” and “SEWN_Screenshots” to throw user-friendly errors for known issues (missing parameters, invalid tokens, membership expired).
Provide localized error strings or filterable messages for site administrators to customize.
H) Final UI Polish
Summaries on Dashboard.
• Display the count of screenshots taken, recently used fallback services, and top membership usage stats (if relevant).
Improve “API Management” Layout.
• Show a table of recent fallback calls, API key usage, and success/failure rates.
Add Contextual Tooltips.
• Where appropriate, add WP tooltips or help tabs to guide administrators on each setting’s meaning.
By addressing these items, the “Startempire Wire Network Screenshots” plugin would deliver on its full potential, closely integrating with the Startempire Wire ecosystem while offering robust, scalable screenshot generation, caching, testing, and membership-based access.
