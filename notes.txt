CURRENT AVAILABLE WORKING FUNCTIONALITY (DO NOT ABBREVIATE)

Based on the provided code snippets in the “Startempire Wire Network Screenshots” WordPress plugin, the following functionality appears to be currently implemented and operational:
• Screenshot Capture Mechanism.
The “SEWN_Screenshot_Service” class (in “class-screenshot-service.php”) contains methods “take_screenshot_with_wkhtmltoimage()” and supporting logic, indicating the plugin can capture screenshots via the wkhtmltoimage binary.
There is logic present to handle different screenshot options such as width, height, and a JavaScript delay.
• Fallback Services and API Manager.
The “SEWN_API_Manager” class includes references to fallback services such as “Screenshot Machine” and placeholders for additional fallback providers. This suggests that if the primary method (likely wkhtmltoimage) is unavailable or fails, the plugin can attempt to generate screenshots through an external API.
The plugin stores fallback service credentials (API keys, etc.) in WordPress options.
• Logging Functionality.
The “SEWN_Logger” class and “SEWN_API_Logger” class provide the ability to log debug, warning, and error messages to a designated file or database table.
Various plugin classes (including “SEWN_Screenshots”, “SEWN_Admin”, etc.) pass context objects that can be written to logs for debugging.
• REST API Endpoints.
The main plugin file (“startempire-wire-network-screenshots.php”) registers at least one REST route (in the “register_routes()” function or a similarly named function), enabling screenshot requests (e.g., “/wp-json/sewn-screenshots/v1/screenshot”) and plugin status endpoints.
The “handle_screenshot_request()” method in “SEWN_Screenshots” likely processes inbound requests with parameters “url” and “type”.
The plugin code suggests partial completion of endpoints for caching logic, returning status data, and purging the cache.
• Admin Interfaces.
The plugin has several classes (“SEWN_Dashboard”, “SEWN_Admin”, “SEWN_Menu_Manager”, “SEWN_Settings”, “SEWN_API_Manager”, “SEWN_API_Tester”, etc.) that provide WordPress Admin Pages. They register menus and submenus such as “Dashboard”, “API Tester”, “API Management”, “Settings”, and “Test Results”.
“SEWN_Admin” includes methods for rendering a “tester page” for generating or testing screenshots from within the WordPress Admin panel.
The “SEWN_Dashboard” class includes methods to render a general plugin dashboard with statistics about captures and cache usage.
The “SEWN_Settings” class manages reading and updating plugin-specific WordPress options (such as the path to wkhtmltopdf, fallback credentials, etc.) and rendering the WordPress Settings interface.
Scripts like “admin.js”, “admin-settings.js”, and “api-tester-enhanced.js” contribute JavaScript-driven UI elements in the admin area, offering user interactions such as regenerating API keys, toggling key visibility, or running tests.
• Test Execution Framework (Partial).
There are multiple test classes in “/tests/” (for example “test-screenshot-service.php”, “test-ajax-handler.php”, “test-integration.php”, etc.) that use “SEWN_Test_Case” as a base. These tests appear intended to be run from within WordPress or the plugin environment to verify screenshot generation, error handling, and admin UI interactions.
The “SEWN_Test_Results” class appears to manage or record test results, with partial code to capture passed/failed assertions.
• Basic Caching Layer.
There is mention of a “cache/purge” REST route and references to clearing or purging cached screenshots at path “.../screenshots/”. The plugin checks for existing files before deciding to generate a new screenshot.
• Integration Hooks.
The plugin registers activation and deactivation hooks (“register_activation_hook” and “register_deactivation_hook”) to set up or remove relevant database tables (e.g., “sewn_api_logs”) or schedules.
Some references are made to verifying premium membership or user roles to handle certain functionalities.
COMMENT EXTENSIVELY ON INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION (DO NOT ABBREVIATE)
• Premium Access Verification.
Within “SEWN_Screenshots” there is a method “verify_premium_access()” that references a token. Although the logic suggests the plugin intends to check whether a user or request is premium, the actual integration with membership levels or an external membership service is not fully fleshed out. There is no fully robust membership check or portal integration code (only placeholders and references).
• Fallback Services API Integration.
The plugin references a fallback system for capturing screenshots if the local wkhtmltoimage fails or is not available. However, the “SEWN_API_Manager” only has partial logic to handle keys and fallback endpoints. The practical logic for actually calling the external fallback services is either incomplete or not fully integrated. The code references “wp_send_json_error” and “wp_send_json_success”, but the details to send calls to the fallback screenshot providers seem partial.
• Full Testing Framework.
Although there are numerous test files under “/tests/”, it appears that the test execution environment is partially incomplete. The “SEWN_Test_Results::run_all_tests()” method tries to discover test classes, but there is not a complete interface hooking everything cohesively into WordPress for a typical “phpunit” or browser-based test approach.
The mechanisms for storing test results in the database or showing them in the WordPress Admin appear to be partially in place but not entirely proven functional.
• Additional REST Endpoints.
There are references (in the plugin’s “README.md”) to potential endpoints for plugin status, cache purging, or verifying membership. While some code references exist, the logic for robust user authentication and role-based or membership-based restrictions is incomplete.
• Illustrated Admin UI for Summaries.
The plugin code references an “API Dashboard”, a “Tester Page”, integration with “SEWN_API_Manager” to show statistics, fallback usage, and key regeneration. Large sections of UI code exist, but certain aspects, such as the “Dashboard” or “screenshots” listing, or advanced fallback configuration, are either incomplete or not fully tested and integrated.
• Database Table “sewn_api_logs” or “sewn_test_results”.
There is partial code referencing a custom table for logging “sewn_api_logs” and storing test results or request logs. The creation logic is partially in “SEWN_Dashboard::get_storage_stats()” and in the classes referencing “dbDelta”. But thorough usage of that table, including listing logs in the Admin UI, is incomplete.
• Membership or OAuth Integration.
The bigger vision from “bigpicture.mdx” notes that the plugin should connect to the Startempire Wire Network for membership-based access and usage. The plugin code references the possibility of throwing errors if a user is not a premium member, but it does not show actual “Startempire Wire Network” membership validation or an OAuth handshake. This is presumably deferred for future integration steps.
• Automated Scheduling or Bulk Screenshot Generation.
The plugin references partial attempts at queue-based or asynchronous screenshot generation in the code commentary, but actual scheduling, queueing, or cron usage so that large-scale screenshot requests do not overload the server is not fully implemented. The code references the potential for “Large requests to strain your server”, but no complete solution is present.



EXTENSIVELY DETAILED STEPS TO COMPLETE ALL PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONALITY (DO NOT ABBREVIATE)

Below is an expanded outline to finalize or improve the plugin’s incomplete components:
A) Premium Access Verification
Integrate with Startempire Wire Membership.
• Implement an OAuth or membership check in the “verify_premium_access()” function, verifying if the token is valid, belongs to an active membership, and has screenshot privileges.
• Update error responses to provide membership-level details when a request fails.
Provide Admin UI Controls.
• Allow the plugin admin settings to store membership endpoints, client/secret if OAuth is required, and handle token refresh flows.
• Display membership statuses in the plugin’s “Dashboard” or “API Management” pages.
B) Fallback Services Expansion
Implement Actual API Calls.
• In “SEWN_API_Manager” or “SEWN_Screenshot_Service”, add a method to build and send requests to fallback providers (e.g., Screenshot Machine).
• Include robust error handling and parse the service’s response to produce a local file or forward a response URL.
Extend Admin Configuration.
• Collect and store fallback credentials in WordPress options.
• Provide a test interface to verify that the fallback service is reachable (under “API Tester” or “Tester Page”).
C) Full Testing Framework
Centralize Test Execution.
• Implement a direct test runner accessible via WP-CLI and/or from the “Test Results” page. This runner should call “SEWN_Test_Results::run_all_tests()”, collect results, and display them in a unified table or log.
Database Logging of Test Runs.
• Expand “SEWN_Test_Results” to store results in the custom table, capturing test name, success/failure, and time of test.
• Display them meaningfully in the “Test Results” admin screen, with filters or pagination if many tests are run.
D) Additional REST Endpoints for Membership and UI Flows
Enhanced Status Endpoint.
• Return membership statuses, fallback usage stats, and possible usage limits.
Protected Endpoints for Issuing Premium Tokens.
• Let administrators or authorized clients manage membership tokens, with logs stored in “SEWN_API_Logger.”
E) Automated Scheduling or Bulk Screenshot Generation
Implement WP-Cron Integration.
• Create a routine that checks for any pending bulk screenshot tasks, generating them at scheduled intervals to avoid server overload.
Provide Bulk Management in Admin.
• In “SEWN_Admin” or “SEWN_Dashboard” classes, add a UI for administrators to queue multiple screenshot capture requests and view progress.
Queued Logging.
• Log each step of the queue to the “wp_sewn_api_logs” table so administrators can troubleshoot failures.
F) Thorough Documentation and Example Code
Finish “README.md” with Usage Examples.
• Show code snippets for typical “fetch” or “curl” requests to “/wp-json/sewn-screenshots/v1/screenshot”.
• Include instructions on setting advanced config (like membership tokens).
G) Error Handling Improvements
Expand “try/catch” blocks in “SEWN_Ajax_Handler” and “SEWN_Screenshots” to throw user-friendly errors for known issues (missing parameters, invalid tokens, membership expired).
Provide localized error strings or filterable messages for site administrators to customize.
H) Final UI Polish
Summaries on Dashboard.
• Display the count of screenshots taken, recently used fallback services, and top membership usage stats (if relevant).
Improve “API Management” Layout.
• Show a table of recent fallback calls, API key usage, and success/failure rates.
Add Contextual Tooltips.
• Where appropriate, add WP tooltips or help tabs to guide administrators on each setting’s meaning.
By addressing these items, the “Startempire Wire Network Screenshots” plugin would deliver on its full potential, closely integrating with the Startempire Wire ecosystem while offering robust, scalable screenshot generation, caching, testing, and membership-based access.
